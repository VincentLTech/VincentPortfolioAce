* You also might want to create a lib folder and have a utils.ts file in it.  
* utils.ts is a helper function that helps everything run well with tailwind
* You are going to want to change lib into utils and utils.ts into cn.ts to match the aceternity system
* I kept lib folder around incase you get confused
